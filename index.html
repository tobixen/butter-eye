<h1>Smørøyet</h1>

Eventually there will be a web site here for the sailing boat "Smørøyet", currently staying at the Kambo marina near Moss, Norway.  As for now there is some information at <a href="http://tobias.u.bitbit.net/butter">etherpad</a>.  The boat is owned by Tobias Brox and family.

"Smørøyet" ... google translate currently seem to translate it into "lubricate the eye", litterally it's translated into "butter eye".  There is actually a Norwegian wikipedia article explaining it pretty well.  "Et smørøye" is a lump of butter placed in the middle of a dish, normally a hot porridge, like rice porridge.  The phrase "midt i smørøyet" can be translated to be at the right place at the right time, it may be centrally in a town, it may be in the "heart of the action", but it's always with a positive slant, it's implied that one has a good time because one is being at the right place.  The name probably has a double meaning, it's visually a yellow boat, maybe sticking a bit out among all the other white boats (just like the "butter eye" sticks out yellowish from the white rice porridge) in the marina or in a harbour - or sticking out yellowish from the blue sea.  When being in the middle of the boat ("midt i Smørøyet"), one is probably having a good time.  Most coastal towns have a very centrally placed guest harbour, so one can go there and really be "midt i Smørøyet".
